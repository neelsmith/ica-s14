Some scholars have argued that the clear stylistic changes (particularly in sculpture) marking the beginning of the Classical period ca. 480 BCE are a response to the Greek experience of war with and, unexpectedly, victory over the Achaemenid Persian Empire.  In this interpretation, the change in artistic taste, especially in public, monumental art, reflects a new understanding of the position of Greece in the world.

## Style and history ##

Choose  a pair of  works, one late Archaic and one early Classical, and identify specific stylistic differences between them.  Do you think the differences you have described support this view.  Why or why not?
