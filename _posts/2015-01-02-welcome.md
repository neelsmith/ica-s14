Welcome to the discussion blog for "Introduction to Classical Archaeology," S'15.  We'll use this site for postings on weekly discussion topics beginning January 25.

Please post to the blog using your Holy Cross Google email ID.  The first time you comment on the blog, you'll need to register your email with disqus, a free service that hosts threaded discussions like this blog.

For January 19, please post a comment here to introduce yourself to the rest of the participants in the course.  Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that is not known to the Holy Cross Registrar's Office (so something more than "I'm a senior majoring in X").
