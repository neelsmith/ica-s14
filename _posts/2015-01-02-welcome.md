Welcome to the discussion blog for Classics 160, "Introduction to Classical Archaeology." In the spring semester of 2015 we'll use this site for postings on weekly discussion topics.

Please post to the blog using your Holy Cross Google email ID.  The first time you post a comment, you'll need to register your email with disqus, a free service that hosts threaded discussions like this blog.

For **January 19**, please post a comment here to introduce yourself to the rest of the participants in the course.  Tell us one interesting fact about yourself that is not known to the Holy Cross Registrar's Office (so something more than "I'm a senior majoring in X").
