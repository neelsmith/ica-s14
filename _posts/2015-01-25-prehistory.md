Archaeology lets us study civilizations that did not have writing; for civilizations with some form of writing, archaeology lets us study aspects of their past that written records do not document.  The Late Bronze Age (on the Greek mainland, also called the Mycenaean period)  and the Geometric period in Greece illustrate this clearly.
