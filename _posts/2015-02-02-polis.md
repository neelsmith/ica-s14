Archaeologists and historians often argue that in ancient world, political, social, military, economic, and religious systems were more tightly integrated and interdependent than in modern societies.   By the end of the eighth century BCE,  the institution integrating all of these aspects of society was the *polis*. 


## Responses

Pick out four to five changes in the archaeological that tell us something about the new Greek *polis*.  Include at least one from each of:

- the territory of an individual polis
- a colonial foundation
- the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Delphi and Olympia
